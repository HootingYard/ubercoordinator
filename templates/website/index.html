    <p><em>To study these writings in their whole extent, to see
        them in their minute unfoldment, is a work of years.</em></p>

    <p class="footnote"><strong class="footnote">Note&nbsp;:</strong> This archive contains audio players for stories that were read on <em>Hooting Yard on the Air</em>. They are marked with <span class="speaker">&#xf028;</span> symbols. Not every reading has been detected though, and not everything read on the show made it onto the internet, so do peruse both archives!</p>
